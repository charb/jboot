## JBOOT

JBOOT reduces the cost that you have between Maven compile time and the produced artifacts at production runtime.

JBOOT allows you to run your JAVA compiled code using the Maven repository used during compile time. 

Distance between compile time and runtime is very close, removing all possible errors.

Check the wiki for more information.
